# AlignmentFree-Hadoop
Hadoop implementation Alignment Free Algorithms for biological sequences comparison using different distances

In this project we implemented known algorithms for calculating dissimilarities between genomic or biological sequences in the form of distances between couples of sequences.

We implemented:

* 3 distances from the D2 family (D2, D2S and D2*)
* utilities for using different character appearance probabilities for D2 distances
* the CV framework for utilizing the Composition Vector method on different known distances
* Kullback-Leibler Divergence (KLD)
* Jensen-Shannon Divergence (JSD)
* Co-Phylog
* all the necessary objects for the sequential and parallel execution of all these distances, using the Map-Reduce paradigm on the Hadoop framework.
